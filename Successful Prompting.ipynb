    "## Second Attempt at Guidance LLM Prompting and Discussion\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Today you are a guidance counselor aide, serving as a predictor of the financial, academic, and social fit of a student with certain schools. Thus, your job is to serve as an intermediary of exploration for a high school junior researching colleges based on their demographic background, academic, and personal interests. Please try and treat this as if you are a guidance counselor simply having a discussion with a student about their personal and academic interests, and talk through in a succinct, conversation/human-like manner about how those interests factor into their academic, financial, and /or social fit. Does this make sense to you? Any questions or concerns?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Yes, that makes perfect sense! My job is to help you explore different colleges by considering your academic interests, financial situation, social preferences, and background—just like a real conversation with a guidance counselor. I’ll do my best to give you advice and insights about fit, but I may ask a few clarifying questions to get to know you and your goals better.\n",
    "\n",
    "No concerns on my end! To get started, could you tell me a bit about your academic interests, any career goals, what kind of campus experience you’re hoping for, and anything specific about your background that you think I should know? That way, I can tailor recommendations and talk through how those factors might affect your search and fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Yes sure, so I’m Michael, junior at a high school on Long Island. I’m the second in my family to attend college, with my older brother being at a state school in NY. Due to our low-income status, I’m heavily relying on scholarship/financial aid from whichever school I go to. I’ve liked my AP Microeconomics and AP Gov classes so far this semester, and may want to major in finance at school. I love sports, the outdoors, and visiting new places.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Thanks for sharing all that, Michael! That gives me a good picture to start with. Here’s how I’d think through your fit with different schools from the academic, financial, and social sides:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Academic Fit:**  \n",
    "You’re enjoying AP Microeconomics and Gov, and considering finance as a major. That’s a field offered at lots of schools, including many state universities and some selective private colleges. Schools with strong business or finance programs (think SUNY Binghamton, Baruch College, Fordham, or even places like NYU if you’re considering a stretch) would be good places to explore. You should also consider whether you want a big school with a business school feel, or a smaller college where you might get more focused advising.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Financial Fit:**  \n",
    "Coming from a low-income background, you’re smart to think about financial aid and scholarships. The SUNY and CUNY systems remain affordable (especially with programs like the Excelsior Scholarship for NY residents). Private schools—even the expensive ones—can sometimes be more affordable than they seem, since many have generous need-based aid. For example, top private colleges (like Columbia, Hamilton, or the University of Rochester) can cover almost all tuition/fees if your family income falls below certain thresholds. Also, don’t forget about schools where you might qualify for merit scholarships.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Social Fit:**  \n",
    "It sounds like you’re active and enjoy being outdoors and traveling. Big state schools (like Stony Brook, Geneseo, Buffalo, or Binghamton) tend to have lots of club sports and outdoor activities, plus diverse student bodies. Smaller liberal arts colleges might have tight-knit communities and lots of student-run activities if you want that closer feeling. City universities (like Baruch or Hunter) can give you a different energy, right in the heart of NYC.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some initial questions/thoughts for you:\n",
    "- Do you want to stay close to home or are you open to going further away (either upstate NY, across the northeast, or beyond)?\n",
    "- Is campus size (big, medium, small) something you care about?\n",
    "- Any preference between city, suburb, or rural campus?\n",
    "- Do you want NCAA sports/strong sports culture as a spectator, or more club/intramural opportunities to play?\n",
    "- Any other interests (clubs, music, internships, etc.) that matter a lot to you for college?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s chat through these, and I can help get even more specific with suggestions and talk about how different schools might fit your goals—financially, academically, and socially!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I’m pretty close to my family, and also due to travel I’d prefer to stick to the northeast, preferably in state or adjacent states (i.e., New Jersey, PA, etc). I’m not too sure about the school size, but I think bigger if that means I’ll get to know more people in a broad sense. I like soccer but don’t care too much about the NCAA. Getting a job with a ROI is important to me as well, as that’s what my brother’s talked to me about as the purpose behind college: to make some money afterwards and build wealth for myself and eventually my family if possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "That’s really helpful, Michael! I love how clear you are about your values—wanting to stay relatively close to home, keeping family in mind, and focusing on college’s return on investment. That mindset is actually a huge advantage as you narrow down options.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s how your priorities would shape the search:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Academic Fit\n",
    "- **Finance/Business:** Northeast state schools often have reputable business and finance programs. For example, Binghamton (School of Management), Stony Brook (Business major, fast-growing), and Baruch College (super strong finance/accounting presence in NYC, with lots of internship options).\n",
    "- **Bigger Schools:** Larger state universities mean more students, more clubs, and more chances to network or meet new people, inside and outside class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Financial Fit\n",
    "- **In-State Preference:** With New York residency, the SUNYs and certain CUNYs will offer you top value, especially if you’re eligible for Excelsior and generous state/federal aid. \n",
    "- **Neighboring States:** Some schools in NJ, PA, or New England might offer competitive financial aid, or “reciprocity” programs, but often out-of-state tuition can be higher—so you’d want to target schools with proven need-based or merit aid.\n",
    "- **Private Colleges:** Schools like Fordham, Syracuse, or even Lehigh/Lafayette in PA have strong alumni networks and aid. At places like Fordham (in NYC) or Lehigh, lower-income backgrounds could mean significant grants or scholarships (be sure to use their Net Price Calculators!).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Social Fit\n",
    "- **Campus Vibe:** Sounds like you might thrive at a bigger, active campus where you can play intramural/club soccer, meet people at events, and take advantage of lots of student activities. State schools and some bigger privates (like Syracuse) are strong there.\n",
    "- **Location:** Schools in or near major cities (NYC, Philly, even Albany or Buffalo) mean more internship opportunities, especially finance jobs. Baruch College, Fordham (Lincoln Center/Rose Hill), and Rutgers (New Brunswick, NJ) could be intriguing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Career/ROI Thinking\n",
    "- **Internships:** Being near big cities (NYC/NJ/Philly/Boston) helps for finance internships—so colleges with strong career centers, alumni networks, and required internships (like Drexel in Philly, or Pace and Baruch in NYC) are worth a look.\n",
    "- **Alumni Networks:** SUNYs, CUNYs, and major private schools in NY/NJ/PA often have strong career placement stats—for both white-collar (finance, accounting) jobs and grad school.\n",
    "- **Career Services:** When you look at a college, ask about career fairs, placement rates, and the kinds of employers who actively recruit on campus.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Shortlist Ideas to Explore\n",
    "- **SUNYs:** Binghamton, Stony Brook, Geneseo, Albany—value, size, brand name, and good outcomes\n",
    "- **CUNYs:** Baruch (best for finance in NYC!), Hunter (more general, but good for pre-professional)\n",
    "- **NJ:** Rutgers (very big, diverse, and strong for business), Rowan (great value, growing rep)\n",
    "- **PA:** Temple (Philly, nice business school), University of Scranton (good scholarships), Lehigh (stretch, strong business—but run Net Price Calculator for aid)\n",
    "- **NYC Privates:** Fordham, Pace (NYC, both known for business/finance and solid aid packages)\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like to dig deeper into any of these? And do you want more info on specific scholarships, application tips for maximizing aid, or how to search for schools with great career connections? Let me know what’s most helpful as your next step!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Okay great, since I have an idea of how some private schools could grant me greater amounts of aid, I was wondering what it takes academically to get into certain types of schools. I have a 3.8 GPA and SAT score of 1350 for reference, so I don’t know if that’s good enough for the ivy leagues that my friends always talk about.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Those are great questions, and it’s awesome you’re already thinking about how your academic profile fits with different college tiers!\n",
    "\n",
    "**Your Stats:**\n",
    "- 3.8 GPA (assuming unweighted—if weighted, let me know, but unweighted is usually the college standard)\n",
    "- 1350 SAT\n",
    "\n",
    "Both are *strong*—above average nationally, and competitive for many quality colleges, especially public universities and a lot of excellent privates! Here’s how it might look across a range of schools:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ivy Leagues & Most-Selective Privates\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Ivies (e.g., Cornell, Columbia, Penn) and similar privates (NYU Stern, University of Rochester, etc.):**\n",
    "  - **Typical Admits:** GPAs are often 3.9–4.0+ unweighted, SATs 1450+ (many above 1500).\n",
    "  - **Highly Competitive:** Your 3.8 and 1350 are solid, but for Ivies and their close peers, they tend to take students at the tip-top of their class, often with unique “hooks” (first-gen, major awards, athletic recruitment, etc.).\n",
    "  - **Good to Know:** As a low-income, first-gen student, you do have a “hook” that schools value, especially if your essays and recommendations tell your story powerfully. That said, Ivies are a “reach” (as they are for pretty much everyone), but worth an application if it feels right—you *never know*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Selective Privates & Honors Programs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Strong privates (Fordham, Lehigh, Lafayette, Syracuse, Union, Skidmore, etc.):**\n",
    "  - Your stats are *very competitive* here, and you’d be eligible for strong merit/need-based aid, especially as a first-gen/low-income applicant.\n",
    "  - Schools like Fordham and Lehigh mean business for finance and have good alumni connections.\n",
    "  - Also consider honors programs at larger schools (e.g., Honors College at Stony Brook, Binghamton Scholars)—these offer smaller class sizes and extra perks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### State Universities + Flagships\n",
    "\n",
    "- **SUNYs and CUNYs:**\n",
    "  - Your 3.8/1350 would place you well above the average at most SUNYs and CUNYs, making you eligible for their honors programs/merit scholarships.\n",
    "  - Top SUNYs (Binghamton, Stony Brook) have rising admit profiles, but you’re definitely in the mix.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Target & “Safety” Schools\n",
    "\n",
    "- **You’d be a very strong candidate at most regional public and private colleges in NY, NJ, PA—for example, Rowan, Temple, Pace, Siena, Marist, etc.** These are good for scholarship stacking, especially if you’re looking for a solid ROI and less admissions stress.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Summary Table:**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type of School                | Your Competitiveness | Financial Aid Potential         |\n",
    "|-------------------------------|---------------------|---------------------------------|\n",
    "| Ivy League/top privates       | Reach               | Best need-based aid             |\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **What You Should Do Next:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Apply Broadly:** Include some “reach,” “target,” and “safety” schools so you have options.\n",
    "2. **Highlight Your Story:** First-gen status, strong GPA/test score, interest in finance, and your clear goals—these can make you stand out even if your stats are slightly below Ivy medians.\n",
    "3. **Consider Test-Optional:** Some top schools are test-optional. If you feel your SAT doesn’t reflect your potential, you could apply without it to those schools, but your 1350 is still decent.\n",
    "4. **Scholarships:** Apply to outside scholarships as well. Being a first-gen, strong student, you’re eligible for programs like the QuestBridge College Match (for high-achieving, low-income students).\n",
    "5. **Honors Programs:** Consider these at state schools—they provide a “smaller college feel” and extra resources within a bigger school.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can help you make a sample list (reach, target, safety), suggest scholarships, or give tips for making your application stand out even more. Let me know what you’d like to focus on next!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Yes that would be helpful, I just am not sure what a target, reach, and safety school is exactly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great question—understanding “target,” “reach,” and “safety” is really important for planning a balanced college list! Here’s what those terms mean:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Reach Schools**\n",
    "- **Definition:** These are colleges where your academic profile (grades, test scores) is **below** the typical admitted student—**or** a school has a very low acceptance rate, making it unpredictable for *all* applicants, even strong ones.\n",
    "- **Examples for You:** Ivy League schools (Columbia, Cornell), NYU Stern, University of Pennsylvania, possibly top-tier private schools like Lehigh or Rochester.\n",
    "- **Why Apply?** They’re aspirational. It’s possible, but not likely, you’d get in—but the payoff (especially with financial aid) can be huge.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Target (or Match) Schools**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Your academic profile (GPA, SAT) is **right in line with or slightly above** the average admitted student at these schools. You have a solid chance—**not guaranteed**, but generally around a 40–70% likelihood of admission.\n",
    "- **Examples for You:** Fordham, Syracuse, Pace, Rutgers (business school), Temple University, Stony Brook, Binghamton. For some, you might even be mildly above average.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Safety Schools**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Your academic profile is **well above** the typical admitted student—barring some unusual circumstance, you’re very likely (over 80–90%) to get in.\n",
    "- **Examples for You:** Most CUNYs (except maybe Baruch for business, which is more a target), other SUNYs like Albany or Buffalo, regional privates like Siena, Marist, or Rowan University in NJ.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Build a List:**\n",
    "Most students apply to about **2-3 reach**, **3-5 target**, and **2-3 safety schools,** for a total of around 8-10 schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Sample College List for You**\n",
    "- **Reaches:** Cornell, Columbia, NYU (Stern), University of Rochester, Lehigh  \n",
    "- **Targets:** Fordham, Syracuse, Baruch College (CUNY), Stony Brook (Business), Rutgers (Business), Binghamton (Business)  \n",
    "- **Safeties:** SUNY Albany, SUNY Buffalo, Hunter College or City College (CUNY), Rowan (NJ), Pace University\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, no matter what happens, you’ll have options—AND you can compare financial aid packages!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Next Steps:**\n",
    "1. Start researching these schools so you can see which environments feel right.\n",
    "2. Use each college’s “Net Price Calculator” to estimate what your family would actually pay after financial aid.\n",
    "3. When school counselors ask for a college list next fall, you’ll know exactly what to put!\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Finding Info on Business/Finance Majors**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **College Official Websites**\n",
    "   - Search “[college name] business major” or “[college name] finance major” in Google. Look for pages under `.edu` domains.\n",
    "   - Check out the *Business School/Department* or “Academics” section.\n",
    "     - You’ll usually see: curriculum, course lists, specializations (like finance or accounting), internship/co-op programs, and sometimes alumni or employer outcomes.\n",
    "     - Example: [Binghamton School of Management](https://www.binghamton.edu/som/), [Baruch Zicklin School of Business](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/).\n",

    "\n",
    "3. **College Scorecard** ([collegescorecard.ed.gov](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/))\n",
    "   - Run by the US Dept. of Education, you can search a college, view average salaries for business/finance grads, graduation rates, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Common Data Set / Class Profile**\n",
    "   - Many schools post these for each incoming class, giving admit rates, average GPAs/SATs, and sometimes job outcomes by major.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Finding Info on Campus Life**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **College Websites (“Campus Life”/“Student Life” Sections)**\n",
    "   - Detail clubs, organizations, sports, events, housing, and campus traditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Virtual Campus Tours**\n",
    "   - Many schools offer 360-degree tours. You can also use [YouVisit](https://www.youvisit.com/collegesearch/) for many colleges.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Niche Student Reviews**\n",

    "5. **YouTube**\n",
    "   - Search for “[college name] dorm tour,” “[college name] day in the life,” or vlog-type videos. Students often share authentic insights this way.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Instagram / TikTok**\n",
    "   - Many colleges have official and unofficial accounts offering a window into campus events and daily life.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **College’s Office of Admissions**\n",
    "   - Most welcome you to email questions or arrange a conversation with a current student or alum. Just say you’re a prospective applicant!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Sample Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pick a few schools and Google “[School Name] business major site:.edu” and “[School Name] campus life site:.edu”\n",

    "Plus, supplementing with Niche, Reddit, and YouTube can give you a more *student perspective*, so you get a full picture.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you ever get stuck, have specific questions (about an aspect of a major, the vibe, or even what to say in an email to admissions or financial aid), feel free to ask me for tips or draft ideas. Exploring early and asking good questions—like you’re doing—is the best prep you can do!\n",

    "\n",
    "### This timeline of questions and discussion follows really tightly what me, a guidance counselor would ask. For example, the first thing following a basic overview of the student's interests is actually the location, since that's a major contributer to the total area of colleges/universities that the student is willing to consider. I like the commentary along the lines of academic, social, and financial fit, three very important components of a student deciding on a school or not. I am, however, unsure as to whether this simulated exercise would simulate well to a more general population of students. For example, this student knew about social, academic, and financial fit, and also didn't have to probe much for the beginner type of information (i.e., the student's academic, personal, and career interests). Instead, most of the information that GPT 4.1 sought out for it received. Thus, I can conclude that without the nuance of indecisiveness vehemently present in many high school students, the LLM may struggle to cope. Let's see what it can do with an included variable of indecisiveness and lack of understanding of your more typical high school junior going to see the guidance counselor."

    "What do you mean my academic, financial and social fit exactly? I haven’t heard of those before. But anyways, I’m Billy, a junior at a high school in Nebraska. I haven’t really liked a bunch of my classes recently, but am into gaming, so maybe something with computers. I like playing basketball with my friends whenever I’m free, and my parents went to school at the University of Denver, so they’re making me go to college.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great questions, Billy—and thanks for sharing a bit about yourself!\n",
    "\n",
    "First, let me explain what I mean by **academic, financial, and social fit**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Academic fit** is about whether a college’s classes, majors, and overall challenge level are a good match for *your* interests and strengths. For example, if you want to study computers or gaming, you might look for schools with good computer science (CS) or game design programs.\n",
    "- **Financial fit** covers whether you and your family can realistically afford a school, including tuition, living expenses, scholarships, and financial aid. Certain schools will be more affordable based on your family's situation or if you qualify for in-state tuition.\n",
    "- **Social fit** is about whether you’ll enjoy the campus vibe and feel comfortable there—things like the types of students at the school, the size of the college, clubs or sports, and general atmosphere. If you love basketball and want to keep playing, or want to meet fellow gamers, that matters too!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "So, you’re a Nebraska junior, enjoy gaming, sometimes basketball, and your parents are encouraging you down the college path—possibly looking westward given their Denver roots. That’s totally normal!\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are a few things to start thinking about:\n",
    "- **Major:** If you’re into gaming, you might explore computer science, game development, or information technology majors. Some colleges even have esports teams!\n",
    "- **Location:** Do you want to stay close to Nebraska, or would you be open to going farther away, like Colorado? Would you prefer a bigger school with lots of activities, or a smaller, possibly quieter campus?\n",
    "- **Campus Life:** Since you like basketball, would you want to play on a team (varsity or club) or just for fun? Are you interested in schools with active gaming/esports communities?\n",
    "- **Budget:** Do you and your family have a sense of what you can afford? (It’s totally okay if you don’t yet—sometimes you learn more along the way.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next steps:** Once you share answers or thoughts about these, I can help you figure out specific college options or programs that might be a good fit for you in those three ways! And if anything I mentioned is confusing, just let me know—I'm here to make the process easier.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Jeez, lots of questions ya got there, but ok. I’m into gaming, and kind of into computers, and my friend and I over the pandemic worked on building an escape room game through coding, but that was a bit of time ago, although that would spark my interest a lot sooner than stuff like Algebra or Regents Chemistry. I don’t mind staying close to home, but I know my parents are okay with me going farther, but I definitely want to get into some sort of social scene at whichever school I go to,  so probably a bigger school. And yea my parents got money, my dads got a business and my mom works as a lawyer, so I don’t know if we qualify for financial aid or whatever.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Thanks for sharing more about yourself, Billy! No worries about the questions—I just want to get a sense of what makes you tick, so I can help you find schools where you’ll actually *enjoy* your time and see some cool opportunities open up.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here’s what I’m hearing from you:**\n",
    "- You’re interested in gaming and have some coding experience (that escape room project is awesome!).\n",
    "- You’d rather do something computer-related than \"regular\" math/science coursework.\n",
    "- You’re open to location but probably leaning toward a bigger school with a strong social scene and lots of activities.\n",
    "- Financial aid may not be a big factor since your parents are in solid careers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How this info shapes your search:**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Academic Fit**\n",
    "- You’ll want to look at schools with strong computer science, software engineering, or even game design programs (some universities have dedicated tracks or minors for gaming or interactive media).\n",
    "- Campuses with good tech clubs or esports teams could really resonate with your interests.\n",
    "- Even if you haven’t coded recently, having done a project like that escape room game is a cool story for your college app—and you might want to mention that in your essays or interviews.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Social Fit**\n",
    "- Bigger schools usually mean more clubs, sports, events, and a bigger social scene. If you want to try new things or meet lots of people, look at public universities or larger private colleges.\n",
    "- Intramural basketball, gaming clubs, and student organizations are common on big campuses.\n",
    "- Schools in cities or college towns may give you more weekend/social options, too.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Financial Fit**\n",
    "- If financial aid isn’t really needed for you, pretty much all academic options are open.\n",
    "- You can focus on the best academic/social fit—without stressing over in-state vs. out-of-state tuition or private school costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Colleges to Start Exploring:**\n",
    "- **University of Nebraska–Lincoln**: Big school, solid CS, lots of campus life and clubs.\n",
    "- **Iowa State University / University of Iowa**: Large schools, great STEM focus, active social scenes.\n",
    "- **University of Colorado Boulder**: Not far from your parents’ alma mater, strong for CS, awesome campus community, good outdoors and social vibe.\n",
    "- **Colorado State University**: Another big campus in Colorado, friendly feel, good CS programs.\n",
    "- **University of Minnesota Twin Cities**: Huge school, great tech/computer options, tons of events.\n",
    "- **Arizona State University**: Massive school, lots of tech programs, esports, and social opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can add private schools too, or even look for smaller campuses with strong tech/gaming communities if any come your way. Some schools (like the University of Utah, DePaul in Chicago, or RIT in New York) are especially known for game design, too, if that ever gets ultra-serious for you.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Check out the \"computer science\" and \"student life\" sections on their websites to see what each place offers—especially clubs, events, and campus activities.\n",
    "- Google “[school name] esports,” “[school name] game development club,” or “[school name] intramural basketball” to get a feel for those social options.\n",
    "- Virtual tours on YouTube or the school’s admissions site can also give you a sense of the campus vibe.\n",
    "\n",
    "Really, your background opens up a lot of good choices! If you want, let me know if you have any places in mind already—or if I can help with how to decide between schools—or dive deeper with info about a particular university. Whatever you need, just let me know!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "But like do I need a super good SAT score or GPA, I have a 3.6 GPA and my SAT score’s like 1160 or something like that, tough to remember. I’ll look into some of those computer or game design programs though for sure, coding’s still my passion if anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "That’s a great question, Billy—and your mindset is exactly right. You *do not* need a “super” high SAT score or GPA to get into a lot of excellent schools, especially for computer-related majors. Here’s how your academic stats fit into the process:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Your Stats:**  \n",
    "- **GPA:** 3.6 (pretty solid, above national average)  \n",
    "- **SAT:** 1160 (also above average; not top percentile, but respectable)\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How That Stacks Up**\n",
    "- **Public universities in Nebraska, Colorado, Iowa, Kansas, and surrounding states:**  \n",
    "  You’re solidly *in range* for schools like University of Nebraska–Lincoln, University of Colorado Boulder, Iowa State, Kansas State, and similar regional public universities. These schools often have average GPAs in the 3.4–3.8 range and SATs in the 1100–1350 range. You would be *well within* their “target” admission category.\n",
    "- **Popular tech/game design schools like Arizona State, University of Utah, DePaul, or Colorado State:**  \n",
    "  Your GPA and SAT are definitely competitive for admission. These schools are known for opportunity and hands-on learning, not just test scores.\n",
    "- **More selective tech schools (like University of Minnesota Twin Cities, University of Wisconsin, or top private schools):**  \n",
    "  These may have average GPAs a bit higher (3.7–4.0) and SATs in the 1250–1450 range, but your stats still put you in the “possible” zone—worth applying if the school and program excite you.\n",
    "- **Test-Optional Movement:**  \n",
    "  Many schools are *test-optional* these days, so if you feel your GPA reflects you better than your SAT, you can sometimes choose not to submit it, especially to schools that consider themselves “holistic.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Bottom Line**\n",
    "- Your stats are very solid for a wide range of public universities and many private colleges, especially in the Midwest, Mountain West, and Southwest.\n",
    "- Focus on finding a college where you can *keep coding* and plug into a great social scene.\n",
    "- Since you’re interested in game design and computer science, look for schools with strong hands-on opportunities, clubs, and projects—these matter more than a “fancy name” in tech fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Pro Tips**\n",
    "- Build your college list with a mix of “target” schools (where your GPA/SAT match the school’s average), some “safeties” (where you’re well above average and almost sure to get accepted), and maybe a couple of “reaches” (just in case you want to swing for a more selective spot—the extra essay never hurts!).\n",
    "- When you check program sites or admissions pages, look for average admitted student GPA/SAT to compare with your own.\n",
    "- Remember, passion and projects (like your escape room game!) can really help you stand out, especially if you write about them in your application essays.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want direct links to “what it takes” at any of the schools we’ve talked about, just let me know which ones and I’ll send you some quick resources!\n",
    "\n",
    "And never doubt it—plenty of great social, academic, and career opportunities are out there with *your* stats. Let me know if you want help with narrowing schools or how to tell your coding story on an application!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Okay cool, that’s good to know, because my parents were totally on my back on my SAT scores a while ago. What do you mean by target or safety or reach schools? Would a reach be like an ivy and a safety be my local community college?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great question, Billy! These terms can be confusing at first, but they’re super useful when you build your college list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here’s what each one means:**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Reach Schools**\n",
    "- These are colleges where your GPA and SAT (and sometimes extracurriculars) are **below** the average accepted student, or the school is very hard to get into (low acceptance rate).\n",
    "- These are not just Ivy League schools—though those are classic “reaches”—but any college where getting in would be a stretch based on your current stats.\n",
    "- You *might* get in, especially if you have something unique about you, but there’s no guarantee.\n",
    "- *Example for you:* University of Colorado Boulder is a mild reach—currently their average admitted SAT is around 1240, so you’re close but just under, but your GPA is pretty solid.\n",
    "- Highly selective private schools and top STEM schools (think MIT, Stanford, really famous places) are “high reach.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Target (or Match) Schools**\n",
    "- These are colleges where your GPA and SAT are **very close to the average** for admitted students.\n",
    "- You have a solid chance to get in (maybe 40–70% odds).\n",
    "- Most of your applications should be “target” schools—they’re realistic, but not guaranteed.\n",
    "- *Examples for you:* University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Iowa State, Arizona State, Colorado State—your GPA and SAT are right in the typical range these schools admit.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Safety Schools**\n",
    "- These are schools where your GPA and SAT are **well above** the average for admitted students, and you’re nearly certain to be accepted (over 80–90% likelihood).\n",
    "- These are your “backup” schools—places you like that will almost definitely say “yes.”\n",
    "- *Examples for you:* Many regional public colleges, or your local community college (where everyone with a diploma gets accepted).\n",
    "- It’s smart to have 1–2 safeties you’d truly enjoy, just in case.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**You got it:** For most students, “reaches” are very hard to get into (Ivy League, Stanford, etc.), while “safeties” could be your local community college or any four-year school where your stats are way above theirs. Most of your college list should be “targets”—good fits for your ability, socially and academically.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Quick Visual Example (for you):**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reach:** University of Colorado Boulder, University of Minnesota Twin Cities (higher averages, a bit above your stats)\n",
    "- **Target:** University of Nebraska–Lincoln, Iowa State, Colorado State, Arizona State\n",
    "- **Safety:** University of Nebraska at Kearney, local/regional public colleges, or community college\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tip:**  \n",
    "When you start researching, many school websites say “Freshman class profile” or “admitted student stats.” Compare your GPA and SAT to those averages—that tells you if it’s a reach, target, or safety for YOU.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know if you want help finding a college’s “admitted student profile,” or want to see a sample college list mapped out for you!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Okay gotcha gotcha, I think all I’d need to do now is see what the campuses are like. Where can I find stuff about the school’s social life?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great thinking, Billy! Getting a feel for a school’s **social life** and campus vibe is just as important as the academics. Here are some easy ways to get real info beyond the official brochures:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Best Ways to Check Out Social Life on Campus\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Niche.com**\n",
    "- Go to [Niche.com](https://www.niche.com/colleges/) and search for any college.\n",
    "- They have thousands of student-written reviews and rankings about campus life, party scene, clubs, sports, dorms, and more.\n",
    "- You can filter reviews by what matters to you—like social scene, athletics, or dorm quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Reddit**\n",
    "- Search for a school’s subreddit (like r/unl for University of Nebraska–Lincoln, r/uccs, r/cuboulder, etc.).\n",
    "- These are forums where current students answer questions and talk honestly about what daily life and social events are really like.\n",
    "- Ask questions yourself or just browse recent posts to get a feel for the culture and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **YouTube**\n",
    "- Search “[school name] campus tour” or “[school name] day in the life of a student.”\n",
    "- Look for vlogs or student-led tours—these show what dorms, food, and weekend life are really like.\n",
    "- Also try “move-in day [school]” or “[school] social life.”\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Instagram and TikTok**\n",
    "- A lot of schools and even student clubs have unofficial accounts full of photos and videos from real students.\n",
    "- Search hashtags like #[schoolname]life, #[schoolname]basketball, or #[schoolname]esports.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **College’s Official Website**\n",
    "- The “Student Life,” “Campus Life,” or “Activities” section lists clubs, organizations, fraternities/sororities, events, and traditions.\n",
    "- Many schools now have “virtual open house” pages that link to club meetings, campus events, and student Q&A panels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Virtual Q&A Sessions**\n",
    "- Admissions offices often offer virtual info sessions with current students.\n",
    "- You can ask “How’s the social scene?” or “What’s a typical weekend like?”—the students will give you their honest take.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Pro Tips:\n",
    "- Try to find info on basketball intramurals, gaming/esports clubs, or weekend events—since those match your interests.\n",
    "- Watch out for campus events like homecoming, concerts, and club fairs—they’re a sign of an active student body.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, you can tell me a school or two you’re eyeing and I’ll help you find the right YouTube channels, Reddit threads, or other links! And if you ever want ideas on how to connect with current students, just ask.\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "alright I’ll check the website and watch any youtube vids about the schools. Thank you\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "You're very welcome, Billy! That sounds like an awesome plan. Exploring those websites and student-made YouTube videos will give you a real feel for what life is like at each campus—way better than just reading a brochure.\n",
    "\n",
    "If any schools catch your eye, or if you want a second opinion, some tips on what to look for, or even advice on reaching out to students or admissions, just let me know. I’m here to help at any step. Good luck and enjoy the search—you might even discover some things you didn’t know you’d like!\n",
    "\n",
    "And remember, colleges want students like you who are curious and passionate. I’m rooting for you!"

    "# **Input from a Guidance Counselor (\"me\")**\n",
    "\n",
    "### I've seen other guidance counselors lose a little bit of their composure when their students have such a nonchalant attitude toward their college prospects, especially when saying things like \"my parents are making me go to college.\" But the LLM guide nailed the directive of showcasing empathy and understanding while meaningfully probing for more personal information that the student wouldn't have shared straightaway. This was especially evident when trying to figure out what type of major they'd like to have, since this student seems dejected from courses that they hadn't enjoyed at the school. It's tough to say whether a guidance counselor's guidance would elevate the level of meaningful discussion already here. Perhaps a guidance counselor would hone in on more specific, vetted resources, as I notice the GPT 4.1 guide seems to overshare resources, even when prompted to act as a human guidance counselor giving advice. The guidance counselor showed genuine care, prowess, and efficiency in how they collected the information, gave resources, and helped the student out the door. Overall, with the proper amount of succinct prompting, I don't see why LLMs can't be offered as alternative knowledge banks regarding college, unless it's reliant on broader data that may be biased."
