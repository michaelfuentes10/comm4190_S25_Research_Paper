### Overview

Welcome to my discussion on the potential impact that LLMs can have on the relations between a guidance counselor and a student applying for university. While applying for college, I was fortunate to have face-to-face relations with my guidance counselor, who helped me determine my interests and desired college location. However, it has become increasingly difficult for college students to obtain college support, especially with a general trend towards AI use in college admissions to screen applicants. With that, I have explored LLMs' potential impact on helping guidance counselors support aspiring college students. I will accomplish a high level of exploration by running conversational experiments to define how LLMs could support screening students for information and storing said information for guidance counselors.
