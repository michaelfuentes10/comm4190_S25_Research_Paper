    "### USER\n",
    "Today you are a guidance counselor aide, serving as a predictor of the financial, academic, and social fit of a student with certain schools. Thus, your job is to serve as an intermediary of exploration for a high school junior researching colleges based on their demographic background, academic, and personal interests. Does this make sense to you? Any questions or concerns?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Yes, that makes perfect sense! As your guidance counselor aide, I’ll help you explore colleges that best match your unique background, goals, and interests—including financial considerations, academic programs, and the social environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "To get started, it would help to know a few things:\n",
    "1. **Academic Profile:** Can you share your GPA, standardized test scores (if any), favorite classes, and any academic interests or potential majors?\n",
    "2. **Financial Background:** Are there financial constraints, or do you have preferences regarding scholarships, aid, or in-state vs. out-of-state tuition?\n",
    "3. **Personal Factors:** Are there any extracurriculars you’re passionate about, locations you prefer, or cultural/social settings that help you thrive?\n",
    "4. **Demographics (if comfortable):** Sometimes certain colleges have great support or opportunities for different backgrounds (e.g., first-generation, underrepresented minorities, etc.).\n",
    "5. **Other Priorities:** Any other priorities, like athletics, research, campus size, urban/rural location, etc.?\n",
    "\n",
    "Do you want to start with a specific list of schools, or would you like me to suggest schools based on your answers? Let me know how you’d like to proceed!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Yes of course, I’m Michael Fuentes, I’m a first-generation college applicant, currently a junior. I have a 3.8 GPA and an SAT of 1400. My favorite classes recently have been AP Microeconomics and AP Government. My family is low-income from Long Island, so I’m banking on any school that will offer a lot of financial aid! I do love the outdoors and getting to explore new places while doing good for my community. I don’t really know what type of schools to suggest, so maybe you can start giving me some info. I’m family oriented as well, so I don’t want to move too far away from the northeast US for school.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Thank you for sharing all that helpful information, Michael! Here’s a summary of what you’ve told me:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPA:** 3.8  \n",
    "- **SAT:** 1400  \n",
    "- **Academic interests:** Economics, Government/Political Science  \n",
    "- **Background:** First-generation, low-income, family from Long Island (NY)  \n",
    "- **Priorities:** Strong financial aid, staying in or near the Northeast, family-oriented, loves outdoors and community service  \n",
    "- **Open to:** Suggestions about school types (size, public/private, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break down your **fit** in three main categories before suggesting specific schools.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **Financial Fit**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Need-based aid:** Many top colleges offer generous need-based financial aid for low-income and first-generation students. Schools with large endowments (often private, “need-blind” for domestic students) will likely make the best financial sense.\n",
    "- **In-state SUNYs:** New York’s SUNY schools offer comparatively low tuition and have programs like EOP (Educational Opportunity Program) for first-gen/low-income students.\n",
    "- **QuestBridge & similar:** Some private schools are part of QuestBridge, a program matching high-achieving, low-income students to schools with great financial aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **Academic Fit**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Your stats:** Your GPA and SAT put you in a solid position for selective state schools and many competitive privates, plus you’re taking rigor like APs.\n",
    "- **Interests:** A school strong in economics, political science, and perhaps community engagement/service learning draws you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **Social Fit**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Outdoorsy:** Look for schools with access to parks, hiking, or robust outdoor club offerings.\n",
    "- **Community-oriented:** Schools with service-learning, civic engagement, or strong volunteer programs.\n",
    "- **Family orientation:** Schools within a one-day drive of Long Island so you can stay connected to home.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **School Suggestions to Explore**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **A. Private Colleges with Strong Financial Aid**\n",
    "These schools are “need-blind” and/or meet 100% of demonstrated need.\n",
    "1. **Amherst College (MA)**\n",
    "2. **Williams College (MA)**\n",
    "3. **Bowdoin College (ME)**\n",
    "4. **Wesleyan University (CT)**\n",
    "5. **Vassar College (NY)**\n",
    "6. **Hamilton College (NY)**\n",
    "7. **Colgate University (NY)**\n",
    "8. **Boston College (MA)**\n",
    "9. **Middlebury College (VT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "All are within the Northeast, have outdoors access, prioritize financial aid, and are welcoming to first-gen and low-income students.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **B. Larger Private Schools**\n",
    "1. **Northeastern University (MA)**\n",
    "2. **Boston University (MA)**\n",
    "3. **Fordham University (NYC)**\n",
    "4. **New York University (NYC)** (great financial aid for first-gen/low-income in some cases)\n",
    "5. **Tufts University (MA)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **C. New York State Publics (SUNY System)**\n",
    "You’re in-state, so you’d get lower tuition, and these schools have strong programs and outdoors access:\n",
    "1. **SUNY Binghamton** (honors program = strong academics & good value)\n",
    "2. **SUNY Geneseo**\n",
    "3. **SUNY Stony Brook**  \n",
    "4. **SUNY Albany**  \n",
    "5. **SUNY New Paltz** (very close to hiking, mountains, great community vibe)\n",
    "\n",
    "Also check into **EOP/HEOP** programs—these give extra support (financial, academic, advising) to students like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **D. Urban Schools with Strong Civic Engagement**\n",
    "1. **The New School (NYC)**—strong for political science, community engagement\n",
    "2. **Providence College (RI)**—great political science\n",
    "3. **Trinity College (CT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **How to Explore Further**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Net Price Calculators:** Use each school’s calculator (on their websites) to estimate your real, likely cost.\n",
    "2. **Visit or Virtual Tours:** Many schools offer fly-in/visit programs for first-gen/low-income students. This can help you feel the social fit!\n",
    "3. **Look into support offices:** Google “first generation”, “TRIO”, or “EOP/HEOP” plus the school’s name; see what support they offer.\n",
    "4. **Consider size/location:** Do you want urban, suburban, or rural? (Some of the above span all three.)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Immediate Next Steps:**\n",
    "- Let me know which schools or types of schools sound interesting so I can give you more detail.\n",
    "- If there are particular qualities (size, urban/rural, club sports, etc.) that matter, share more so I can tailor a list even further.\n",
    "- We can also talk about how to prepare for applications, scholarships, and what programs (like QuestBridge) you might benefit from joining this fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know your reactions or follow-up questions!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I’d like more details on how a private school can be feasible in my situation, since my older brother went to a SUNY for financial reasons, so I don’t know how I could ever afford that type of school. I live in a suburban area too, so I guess I’d prefer that over a heavily urban environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "That’s a great, practical question, Michael—many students assume private colleges are out-of-reach financially, but for low-income, first-generation students like you, private schools can sometimes be **more affordable than public universities**! Here’s a detailed breakdown of why and how:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. How Private Colleges Can Be Affordable for You**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. “Need-Blind” Admissions and 100% Need-Met Schools**\n",
    "- **What this means:** Some top (mostly private) colleges promise admission decisions without considering your family’s finances (need-blind), and then commit to **meeting 100% of your demonstrated financial need**.\n",
    "- **How they figure your cost:** They use the FAFSA (and sometimes the CSS Profile) to look at your family’s income, assets, and situation. At many of these schools, families making under ~$60,000 a year **may pay little or nothing for tuition, room, and board**.\n",
    "- **Examples:** Amherst, Williams, Bowdoin, Vassar, Hamilton, and Middlebury (to name a few in the Northeast), along with some larger schools like Boston College.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Generous Grant Aid, Not Just Loans**\n",
    "- These schools have very large endowments/support funds, so most (if not all) of what you get in your aid package will be grants/scholarships you don’t need to repay—**not loans**.\n",
    "- Comparing that to SUNY: At SUNY, you may get state-level aid (like TAP, Excelsior, and Pell Grants), but costs (room/board, fees) can still add up and sometimes involve more loans unless you get into SUNY EOP/HEOP.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **C. Special Programs for First-Gen and Low-Income Students**\n",
    "- Private colleges are increasingly focused on supporting first-gen and low-income students.\n",
    "- Examples: Fly-in programs, summer bridge programs, peer mentoring, and dedicated support services.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. How to See if a Private College is Affordable—for *You***\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **A. Net Price Calculators**\n",
    "- Every college is required to host a **Net Price Calculator** on its website. Put in your family’s financial info (can use estimates now) along with academic info and see what you’d *actually* pay after grants/scholarships.\n",
    "- **Try a comparison:** Use the NPC for a private college (like Vassar or Amherst) *and* a SUNY school—compare the costs after aid.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **B. Special Scholarship Programs**\n",
    "- **QuestBridge:** Matches low-income, high-achieving students to top colleges with full scholarships.\n",
    "- **HEOP (for NYS privates):** If you apply to a NY private college as a first-gen/low-income student, you may qualify for the Higher Education Opportunity Program—extra financial and academic support.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Example—How Aid Might Play Out Compared to SUNY**\n",
    "\n",
    "|                | SUNY Binghamton | Vassar (Private, NY) | Hamilton (Private, NY) |\n",
    "|----------------|--------------------|----------------|------------------|\n",
    "| Sticker Price (tuition, room/board) | ~$28,000 (in-state) | ~$87,000 | ~$85,000 |\n",
    "| Sample Aid for Low-Income Student* | - Pell Grant, TAP/Excelsior, state aid, campus scholarship<br>- Usually some loans | - Meets full need with grants; little/no loans if family income < $60k | - Meets full need with grants; loan-free for many students |\n",
    "| **Net Price for You** | ~$0–$6,000 (with SUNY EOP)<br>(may still involve loans, variable by SUNY campus) | $0–$3,000<br>(may just pay work-study, books, travel) | $0–$3,000<br>(often just work-study, books) |\n",
    "\n",
    "\\*These are typical, not guaranteed, based on national averages and school policies for low-income/first-gen students.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Suburban Private Colleges/Gems to Consider**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Vassar (NY)**\n",
    "  - Suburban, beautiful campus, robust financial aid, strong Gov/Econ programs, near hiking/outdoors\n",
    "- **Hamilton (NY)**\n",
    "  - Rural/suburban, outdoorsy, strong for Econ/PoliSci, meets full need\n",
    "- **Colgate (NY)**\n",
    "  - Rural, very supportive, great aid, close-knit campus, outdoors clubs\n",
    "- **Wesleyan (CT)**\n",
    "  - Suburban, progressive, generous aid\n",
    "- **Amherst, Williams, or Bowdoin**\n",
    "  - All in small towns surrounded by nature, “meet full need”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. What’s Next?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Talk with your family:** Bring up that private schools could cost you *less* than SUNYs because of their bigger endowments and aid policies for low-income/first-gen students.\n",
    "2. **Try net price calculators:** Use at least 2-3 (one SUNY, two private) for a true cost estimate.\n",
    "3. **Check out fly-in programs:** These let you visit for free if admitted (Google “fly-in program” + college name).\n",
    "4. **Look into QuestBridge** for special scholarships/matches—junior year is perfect timing!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions for You:**\n",
    "- Do you want more info on specific schools’ financial aid policies or what materials to gather for Net Price Calculators?\n",
    "- Would you like a step-by-step guide on how to approach “net price” at a particular school?\n",
    "- Are there any other factors (diversity, religion, campus size, specific outdoor activities) you want me to factor into helping you narrow costs/location?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let me know, and I’ll walk you through the next steps or schools in as much detail as you’d like!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I think I can maybe look through a net price calculator, but am not sure if I would be able to work that out with you, so I may leave it there for now, given the smaller list you gave. I also want to prioritize academic fit, specifically with business studies. Do any of these school specialize in business and/or economics in their academic program(s)?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Absolutely, Michael! Your academic interests are key to a great college experience, so let's look at your options for **business and economics** among the private, mostly-suburban schools we discussed. I'll give you a quick rundown of each school's strengths and how they approach business/economics.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Liberal Arts Colleges in the Northeast**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Vassar College (NY)**\n",
    "   - **Economics:** Strong, popular major. Courses cover micro/macro theory, international, labor, and financial economics.\n",
    "   - **Business:** Vassar doesn’t have a formal undergraduate business program. However, Economics majors can pursue finance, consulting, and business careers with great success (and Vassar’s alumni connections are very helpful).\n",
    "   - **Experiential learning:** Lots of research, internship, and alumni networking opportunities.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Hamilton College (NY)**\n",
    "   - **Economics:** One of the most popular and strongest majors. Emphasizes analytics, internships, and real-world research.\n",
    "   - **Business:** No undergraduate business degree, but excellent pre-business advising, plus the “Hamilton in NYC” program places students in business/finance internships in New York City.\n",
    "   - **Note:** Hamilton emphasizes skills that employers value in business (writing, quantitative, critical thinking).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Colgate University (NY)**\n",
    "   - **Economics:** Very robust—frequent top destination for students interested in finance, consulting, government, and business careers.\n",
    "   - **Business:** No undergraduate business major, but very strong alumni pipeline into Wall Street, consulting, and major firms. Economics or Mathematical Economics are the most common pre-business tracks at Colgate.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Amherst College (MA) & Williams College (MA)**\n",
    "   - **Economics:** Both have top-ranked economics departments; many graduates go into business, banking, consulting, or pursue MBAs.\n",
    "   - **Business:** No dedicated undergrad business majors—typical of most top liberal arts colleges.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Bowdoin College (ME) / Middlebury College (VT)**\n",
    "   - **Economics:** Both offer excellent economics programs with lots of alumni outcomes in business, banking, public policy, and NGOs.\n",
    "   - **Business:** No undergrad business majors, but great pre-professional advising.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Mid-sized/Suburban Universities with Business Majors**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are interested in a **more formal undergraduate business degree (BBA, BSBA, Accounting, Finance, Management, etc.)**, some of the previously mentioned schools or slightly larger universities near the Northeast suburbs might be a stronger fit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Boston College (MA)**\n",
    "   - **Carroll School of Management:** One of the top undergraduate business schools in the U.S. Offers B.S. degrees in Finance, Accounting, Marketing, Management, and more.\n",
    "   - **Economics:** Excellent department as well, great for double majoring or minoring.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bentley University (MA)**\n",
    "   - **Specialty:** A business-focused university—highly regarded for its business and accounting programs. Very practical, with tons of real-world learning, internships, and strong job placement.\n",
    "   - **Financial Aid:** Also offers good financial aid, especially for NY students.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Babson College (MA)**\n",
    "   - **Specialty:** Dedicated exclusively to business/entrepreneurship at the undergraduate level (top in the country for entrepreneurship).\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Lehigh University (PA)**\n",
    "   - **Business School:** Highly respected, excellent alumni network in NY, NJ, PA.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Syracuse University (NY)**\n",
    "   - **Whitman School of Management:** Reputable, competitive for NY residents, and a more traditional campus feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Liberal Arts Colleges** usually **do not have a standalone “business” major**. Instead, you would major in **Economics**, sometimes combining with Math, Computer Science, or even Psychology, and then use internships, extracurriculars, and alumni connections to enter the business world.\n",
    "- These schools send a **huge number of grads to top MBA programs and directly into business/finance/consulting jobs** due to great reputation, teaching, networking, and advising.\n",
    "- If you want a **true undergraduate business major**, prioritize universities with named business schools (Boston College, Bentley, Babson, Syracuse, Lehigh, Fordham, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Next Steps & Suggestions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Explore what you prefer:**\n",
    "   - Do you want a well-rounded liberal arts education where you can study Econ and later enter the business world?\n",
    "   - Or do you want a specialized, hands-on business degree from day one?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Look into campus business clubs, internships, and alumni mentoring:** Whatever your major, these are crucial for building experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Check for “pre-business” advising:** Many liberal arts colleges offer workshops, boot camps, and alumni events specifically for students targeting business jobs or MBAs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Quick Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "| School                     | Economics Major | Business Major | Campus Setting     |\n",
    "|----------------------------|:--------------:|:--------------:|-------------------|\n",
    "| Vassar, Hamilton, Colgate, Amherst, Williams | ✔️ | ❌ (pre-business clubs/advising) | Suburban/Rural   |\n",
    "| Boston College             | ✔️ | ✔️ (Carroll School) | Suburban near Boston |\n",
    "| Bentley, Babson            | ✔️ | ✔️ (business-focused)| Suburban near Boston |\n",
    "| Lehigh, Syracuse, Fordham  | ✔️ | ✔️                | Suburban/Urban      |\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Final Thought:**  \n",
    "- If you lean toward Economics and the “liberal arts college experience,” the schools above (Vassar, Hamilton, Colgate, etc.) are outstanding and will absolutely prepare you for business/finance careers, even without a technical “business” major.\n",
    "- If you specifically want **business/management/accounting majors from the start** and a higher proportion of pre-professional coursework, Boston College and similar universities are great fits to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like help focusing your options further, or want more info on internships, alumni success, or a sample course plan in Econ/Business at any of these colleges? Let me know how you want to proceed!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "I guess I can say I’m not too interested in a liberal arts college, but what’s the difference between a liberal arts school and other types of schools that do have business programs?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Great question, Michael! Understanding this difference is crucial in figuring out where you’ll thrive and feel prepared for your career.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Liberal Arts Colleges vs. Universities with Business Programs**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Liberal Arts Colleges (LACs):**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Small, mostly undergraduate-focused schools emphasizing a broad-based education in the arts, sciences, social sciences, and humanities.\n",
    "- **Academic Style:** You typically take courses across many disciplines (writing, math, science, social science, arts), with the goal of making you a well-rounded thinker and strong communicator.\n",
    "- **Majors:** You choose a major like economics, political science, psychology, etc. There’s not usually a “business” or “accounting” major.\n",
    "- **Career Path:** Many LAC grads go on to MBAs or business jobs after majoring in econ, math, or other fields, often using internships and networking, but you aren’t earning a \"business\" degree.\n",
    "- **Class Size & Teaching:** Small classes; professors focus on teaching and mentoring undergrads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:** Vassar, Hamilton, Colgate, Bowdoin, Amherst, Williams, Middlebury.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Universities with Business Programs**\n",
    "- **Definition:** Larger institutions, often with both undergraduate and graduate students, and specific “schools” or “colleges” within them, e.g., a **School of Business**.\n",
    "- **Academic Style:** You can major directly in business fields such as accounting, finance, marketing, management, entrepreneurship, international business, etc.\n",
    "- **Career Prep:** Prepares you with both general education and specialized business training—often includes internships, practical projects, case studies, and career placement services tied directly to business fields.\n",
    "- **Class Size & Teaching:** Larger classes, especially in introductory courses. Faculty may be more research-focused, but there are often strong career services and alumni networks in business fields.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**  \n",
    "- **Boston College** (Carroll School of Management)  \n",

    "- **Universities with Business Programs:** Let you major in business fields directly, surround you with pre-professional resources, and focus your college experience on preparing for work in business immediately after graduation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want to go into business right away and want hands-on, professionally oriented courses and connections, a school with a dedicated undergraduate business program is likely your best fit.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like help researching business programs in the Northeast that are especially supportive of first-gen/low-income students? Or do you want more advice on how to compare these programs? Let me know!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "You’re giving me a lot of information, and it feels a bit overwhelming, but I see, so it’s some larger schools, maybe private schools that offer a broader array of courses for their students. But what I worry about then is, is my GPA and SAT good enough for these schools to even consider me? I know tons of my friends that have 4.0 GPAs and higher SATs and it doesn’t feel the best.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Michael, these feelings are *so* common, and it’s completely normal to feel a bit overwhelmed (and even discouraged) when comparing yourself with others—college admissions can seem really mysterious and stressful. Let’s break down what actually matters, with your stats and interests in mind:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Your Academic Record:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **GPA: 3.8** (unweighted or weighted? Either way, strong!)\n",
    "- **SAT: 1400** (well above national average)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Context:**\n",
    "- The average SAT nationally is around 1050-1100; a 1400 places you in the top ~8% of test-takers.\n",
    "- A 3.8 GPA is impressive, especially in a rigorous course load (with AP classes).\n",
    "- *First-generation/low-income* status is a big positive (“hook”)—colleges seek more students like you.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How Selective Schools Review Applications:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Holistic Admissions:**  \n",
    "Most private universities and quality business programs practice “holistic review.” This means:\n",
    "- **Stats matter, but so does your story**—context, achievements, leadership, essays, character, community work, and overcoming adversity all play large roles.\n",
    "- **First-generation/low-income applicants** often get a “boost” because colleges value diversity of experience, and want to be accessible and supportive.\n",
    "- Many colleges consider *what opportunities you had*, not just *your raw scores*. Taking APs, succeeding in a competitive high school, and contributing positively to your community *counts*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Peer Comparison:**  \n",
    "Admissions offices know that not every applicant had the resources for tutors, test prep, or fancy extracurriculars. A handful of students may have perfect scores, but the majority of those admitted have stats *in the same range as yours*, especially with strong essays, recommendations, and activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Typical Ranges at Some Business Schools**\n",
    "\n",
    "| School                | Median GPA (unweighted) | Median SAT      | What Matters                          |\n",
    "|-----------------------|------------------------|-----------------|---------------------------------------|\n",
    "| Boston College        | 3.7–4.0                | 1370–1510       | Essays, service, activities, context  |\n",
    "| Fordham (Gabelli)     | 3.6–3.9                | 1300–1440       | Service, first-gen, context           |\n",
    "| Lehigh                | 3.7–4.0                | 1340–1480       | Leadership, fit, context              |\n",
    "| Bentley               | 3.5–3.9                | 1200–1380       | Business interest, leadership         |\n",
    "| Babson                | 3.6–3.9                | 1330–1460       | Entrepreneurship, initiative          |\n",
    "| Syracuse (Whitman)    | 3.5–3.8                | 1240–1400       | Service, activities, essays           |\n",
    "\n",
    "**Notice how your SAT and GPA are either within or *very close* to the typical admitted student ranges at these schools!**  \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What You Can Do to Strengthen Your Application**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Focus on your narrative:** Being a first-gen student, pursuing challenging courses, and contributing to your community all make your application stand out.\n",
    "- **Essays matter:** Your story, your motivation, your goals—schools want to hear your “why.”\n",
    "- **Highlight your passions:** Clubs, service, work, family responsibilities—these are *assets*, not liabilities.\n",
    "- **Get to know the admissions rep:** Email, attend online info sessions, and consider asking about fly-in/diversity initiatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Reality:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Admissions is competitive everywhere*, but the most important thing is to build a balanced list—some “reach” schools, more “match” schools where your stats are squarely in range, and a couple of “safeties” where you’re almost certain to be admitted.\n",
    "- **There ARE private business schools in the Northeast that would welcome a student with your accomplishments and background!**\n",
    "- Don’t be afraid of “big name” or private schools—many purposely seek students from your background and have support networks to help you thrive.\n",
    "- **You’re not alone:** Many future first-generation students feel worry or imposter syndrome; it’s okay to feel this way and move forward anyway.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Next Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Don’t rule yourself out!** You’re competitive for a wide range of business programs.\n",
    "2. **Build a balanced list:** We can review schools that are matches, a couple of reaches, and some “likely” options.\n",
    "3. **Connect with your counselor:** Ask about programs for first-gen and local organizations that can help you apply.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want, I can help you build a sample list of business-focused colleges in the Northeast tailored to your stats, interests, and priorities—just let me know! If you want, we can also talk about ways to make your application even stronger, or simply how to deal with these worries. You’re doing *great*—don’t let comparison take away from what you’ve accomplished!\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",
    "Okay I see, I’ll try not to rule myself out then, thank you. Also, I guess something else I’ve heard of social fit, do you know where I can search on these websites to learn more about the social fit of the schools on my list so far?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "I’m really glad you’re keeping an open mind, Michael! **Social fit** is super important—it influences not just your happiness, but your ability to succeed and feel comfortable on campus. “Social fit” can include things like campus vibe, diversity, clubs, traditions, how welcoming the community is, and even what students do for fun.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Here's how you can research social fit on school websites and beyond:**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Start with the School’s Official Website**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Where to Look:**\n",
    "- **Student Life** or **Campus Life** tabs—often on the main menu\n",
    "- **Clubs & Organizations** or **Get Involved**\n",
    "- **Diversity and Inclusion** or **Multicultural Affairs**\n",
    "- **First-Generation Student Resources** or **TRIO/HEOP/EOP**\n",
    "- **Housing & Residential Life** section\n",
    "- **Campus Events Calendar** or “Traditions”\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What to Look For:**\n",
    "- Lists of clubs or student organizations (see if there’s a business club, community service, outdoors club, etc.)\n",
    "- Descriptions of campus traditions and events\n",
    "- Support offices for first-generation, low-income, and/or multicultural students\n",
    "- Special housing options (like living-learning communities, themed houses, or first-gen housing)\n",
    "- Photos/videos of campus events and student hangouts\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Go Beyond the Official Site**\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Student Reviews and Stats:**\n",
    "- **Niche** (niche.com): Student-written reviews and ratings on social scene, diversity, campus feel, etc.\n",
    "- **Unigo** (unigo.com): Honest student feedback on what campus life is *really* like.\n",
    "- **CampusReel** (campusreel.org): Real student video tours—great for seeing dorms, dining, rec centers, and eavesdropping on student convos.\n",
    "- **Colleges’ Instagram/TikTok Pages and Student Influencers:** See what students post and comment, which tells you a lot about community vibe and events.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Ask Directly:**\n",
    "- Many admissions offices will **connect you with a current student** (student ambassador) who shares your interests or background. Reach out and ask to speak with someone!\n",
    "- **Virtual open houses** often have student panels—you can submit questions about community, support, diversity, or anything you care about.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Social Fit Resources for First-Gen/Low-Income Students**\n",
    "\n",
    "- See what programs, offices, and special events the school has for first-gen students—not just academic but social support too!\n",
    "- Ask about mentorship, social clubs, or first-year support programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. A Quick Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you’re checking out *Boston College*:\n",
    "- Go to their website and hover over “Student Life.” Check out “Clubs and Organizations,” “Diversity and Inclusion,” and “First-Generation Students.”\n",
    "- Look up “Boston College social life site:niche.com” on Google to see student reviews.\n",
    "- Search “Boston College campus tour CampusReel” for authentic student videos.\n",
    "- Find the admissions Instagram and see what students and the school share about weekends and traditions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **What to Ask or Search For:**\n",
    "- “Is there a tight-knit campus feel?”\n",
    "- “How do students spend weekends?”\n",
    "- “Are there a lot of commuters or is it residential?”\n",
    "- “What’s it like for first-generation/low-income students?”\n",
    "- “What do students do off-campus?”\n",
    "- “How involved are students in clubs, volunteer work, or campus jobs?”\n",
    "- “How diverse is campus life?”\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Pro Tip:**\n",
    "**If you ever schedule an official visit or information session (virtual or in-person), always ask them to connect you with a student whose background is similar to yours (first-gen, New Yorker, low-income, outdoorsy, etc.)—this gives you the most useful perspective.**\n",

    "Okay great, given what we’ve talked about so far, what is a list of 10 schools you think should be on my list?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ASSISTANT\n",
    "Absolutely, Michael! Based on your background, preferences, and goals—**first-generation, low-income, suburban Long Island, strong academics, interest in business/economics, preference for the Northeast, need for financial aid, love of outdoor and community engagement, and a desire for a supportive social fit**—here’s a tailored list of **10 schools** for you to consider:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Boston College (MA)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Carroll School of Management is highly ranked for business. Suburban setting, lots of campus spirit, strong support for first-gen/low-income students, and excellent financial aid for those with demonstrated need.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Syracuse University (NY)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Whitman School of Management offers direct-entry business. Medium-sized, suburban feel, plenty of NY students, strong financial aid for in-state and low-income applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Fordham University (Gabelli School of Business, NY)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Excellent business program, lots of NY first-gen students, Jesuit school with a strong service and community mission. While in Bronx/Manhattan (urban), the Rose Hill campus feels more suburban.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Bentley University (MA)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Specialized in business, practical focus, strong career placement, suburban campus near Boston, good resources for low-income and first-gen students.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Babson College (MA)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Premier undergraduate business/entrepreneurship school. Suburban and campus-focused, lower student-to-faculty ratio, and a supportive, collaborative feel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6. SUNY Binghamton (NY)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Top public “business school” in the SUNY system (School of Management), very strong value for in-state students, and the EOP program can boost financial and academic support for first-gen applicants.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7. SUNY Geneseo (NY)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Not a formal business major, but a strong business administration program and renowned for student support and community feel. Great value, EOP available.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8. Providence College (RI)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Excellent business school (AACSB-accredited), campus-centered, supportive environment, and a welcoming suburban campus near downtown Providence. First-gen program support.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **9. Lehigh University (PA)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Well-regarded College of Business, suburban campus, strong alumni connections, especially in NY/NJ/PA, and good reputation for supporting first-gen students.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **10. College of New Jersey (TCNJ, NJ)**\n",
    "- **Why:** Highly respected business school, suburban campus, a lot of NY students, collaborative community, and strong value for NY/NJ students. Financial aid is competitive for out-of-state students with your profile.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why These 10?**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Financial Aid:** Most have a history of supporting lower-income and first-gen students (either by generous institutional aid, state programs, or a combo).\n",
    "- **Business Focus:** All offer strong business or management programs with internship pipelines.\n",
    "- **Social Fit:** Medium-sized or campus-focused communities, not overwhelmingly urban, and most offer first-gen resources and thriving campus organizations.\n",
    "- **Academic Fit:** Your GPA and SAT put you within range for all these schools (some might be a “reach,” most are strong “match” fits, and a couple can be “safeties” when you use EOP or have demonstrated need).\n",
    "- **Geography:** All are in the Northeast, within a reasonable distance from Long Island.\n",
    "- **Outdoors/Community:** Most have opportunities for outdoor clubs, volunteering, and campus engagement.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Pro Tips for Your Research:**\n",
    "- Use these 10 as your “core list”—as you learn more, you might drop a few or add a couple that really grab you.\n",
    "- For *SUNYs*, be sure to look into the EOP program and submit all financial aid paperwork early.\n",
    "- For privates, use Net Price Calculators to compare costs carefully.\n",
    "- Contact each school’s first-gen/student support office and business school admissions rep for personalized advice and visit/virtual program options.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**If you want more info on any of these (or want to swap in a different type of school), let me know! I’m happy to go deeper on campus culture, business specializations, or admissions strategies for any college on the list.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### USER\n",

    "\n",
    "**Next steps:**  \n",
    "- Take your time exploring the colleges on your list—use the websites, Net Price Calculators, and student review resources.  \n",
    "- Keep track of what you like/dislike about each as you go.  \n",
    "- Reach out to admissions and student support offices if you have specific questions, especially as a first-gen student.  \n",
    "- And don’t hesitate to ask your school counselor, teachers, or me (if you need more advice later)!\n",
